Title: Hidden Markov Chain model for sequential data

Description: 
We implemented a Hidden Markov Chain model class with latent variable sequence 
generator. With the latent model, we can further assign a generating process from 
each latent state to the real data. A Gaussian generating model is implemented. 
    Aside from generating models and data, we also need to do the inferences. The 
    calculation of log-likelihood of given model and data is incorporated in each 
    model class. 
    
    A sampling process is implemented with Rstan. 
    
    Result visualization and cross-validation.
